        The Surest Path to a Better Brain & Memory and Dementia Prevention
    </div>
    <div class ="mainSection">
        <p>Are you forgetting more these days and remembering less? 
            Do the names of good friends or extended family escape you? 
            This cognitive decline could be a sign of more serious problems to come.
            Increasing memory problems is the # 1 predictor of Alzheimer’s and dementia.<strong>Would you like to learn how to renew your mind and memory to perform as you did 15 or even 20 years ago?</strong> 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>Did you know scientists have discovered how to <strong>reverse cognitive decline</strong> and memory loss, in <strong>most</strong> cases?  Now even symptoms of Alzheimer’s and associated dementia can <strong>usually</strong> be reverse if appropriately addressed <strong>soon enough.</strong> (If you can read and understand the message on this page, it’s likely not too late for you.) </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In 2014 Dr. Bredesen2 at UCLA reversed memory loss and other cognitive decline in 9 out of 10 cases of dementia, 6 of whom had Alzheimer’s. He has since reversed 100’s more. People who had to retire due to cognitive decline, are able to return to work and normal healthy function. To hear Dr. Bredesen discuss these recoveries go to www.youtube.com and type in Bredesen Gundry. We use the Bredesen protocol. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The question is:  <strong>What does it take to achieve such a remarkable recovery?</strong>  
            The Answer:  That depends on what is causing the decline. While our bodies and brains have many needs in common, 
            
            <strong>every body is different and
                every brain has unique challenges and needs.</strong>
            
            So whatever helped your mother, friend, neighbor, brother or even a group of people in a study or on a PBS special, may not help you.  The key is “biological individuality.” 
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong>every body is different and
            every brain has unique challenges and needs.</strong>
            <ul><li>They assess each person’s unique biological needs, meds and mental challenges.</li>
                <li>They are each based on research from a variety of disciplines.</li>
                <li>•	They use a combined “synergistic” approach that meets unique biological, mental & emotional needs, incorporating physical, nutritional, mental & social strategies.  </li>
                <li>•	Trained professionals track progress and tweek plans until success is achieved! </li>

            </ul>

        <p>Dale Bredesen, MD at UCLA, Vincent Fortenasce, MD at USC, Majid Fotuhi, MD former science Director for the Alzheimer’s Assoc, and best selling author David Perlmutter, MD, all use this approach, as do we at the new  Hope Memory Care & Brain Center, in Murray.  </p>
